# loris.ca
The public website of LORIS

### Overview

This is very much a first draft of the LORIS website. There are many improvements and features coming, along with a restructuring of how the html files are created.

Currently the website consists of several static html pages and uses bootstrap css and javascript.

### Contributing

Please fork the repository and send pull requests to contribute.

When developing, you will need to run a small webserver for all of the features to work. You can do this with php version 5.4 or above, for example, by running `php -S localhost:8000` from the repository directory.

Please use the GitHub Issue tracker to report bugs and request features and improvements.

### Todo

##### Before HBM

- Add content
- Put the repository on a VM and point loris.ca to this new location
- Test the contact form

##### Later

- Make the map of LORIS users interactive and informative
- Revisit the features and the screenshots used to describe them
- Add a home page, separate from the original about page
- Add a team section
- Improve the get started page
- Add more documentation to the support section (copy of the LORIS wiki?)
- Improve responsiveness of the website
